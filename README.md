### Some unfortunate yet possible issues  
#### Part 1 : basic html
You may expereience some portability issue : images and videos not being displayed while they should.
This was coded on a Linux - Ubuntu 20.04 machine, using VS Code 1.55.2.
Most of my tests for this part were done using the Live Server option.

Please do trust me when I say ***this works perfectly fine on my computer***, I'm of course available anytime if needed.
Most issues seem to come from the fact that folders and directories are a little different between Linux/MacOS/Windows. 

#### Part 2 - Angular application
Once again, you may experience some portability issues while running the app. 

I wrote paths so that images would be properly displayed on my computer, I do hope it'll work as best as possible on your computer.
While I write this, I have no current issues, all images/videos/others are displayed on my computer.


### Possible improvements 
- My navbar should be collapsible instead of reducing the font size on smaller devices. This could have been easy with bootstrap, but ***I chose not to use Bootstrap for this project***, as I was not comfortable enough with this tool yet and it was bringing other issues in. 

&rarr; I may implement this soon when I am done with other projects, it is doable without Bootstrap.
- My main page could have more elements
- There are so many other projects I would like to put forward, I just kept the ones I liked the most/ the most interesting ones to show yet. I may add those other projects later.
